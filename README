Decode String

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"

Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"

nput: s = "abc3[cd]xyz"
Output: "abccdcdcdxyz"
